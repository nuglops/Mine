I left my job, my boss, my car, and my home
I'm leaving for a destination I still don't know
Somewhere, nobody must have duties at all
And if you like this, you can follow me, so let's go
To the place where we belong and leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy, a destination unknown

Now I won't feel those heavy shoulders, no more
My life got better now I finally enjoy
Yes, all the people want to come here, and so?
Come on and join us, you can do that, now let's go
Follow me, and let's go
To the place where we belong and leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy, a destination unknown, known, known, known
We left the city, the pollution, the crowd
The air is clear here, ocean's blue, I love that sound
We're happy in this destination we found
And if you want this, you can follow me, let's go
Follow me and let's go
To the place where we belong, and leave our troubles at home
Come with me, we can go
To a paradise of love and joy, a destination unknown, known, known
Unknown, known, known, known...
Destination unknown
