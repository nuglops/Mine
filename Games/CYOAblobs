Morcant, as he walks the world after Kesh-Naru, is no longer easily mistaken for a wizard, nor fully for a knight. He is something heavier than either.

He is tall, but never seems to stand at his full height unless violence is unavoidable. His posture carries a habitual forward lean, as though he is always listening for something just ahead of him—a confession, a lie, a last chance to stop. His face is lean and weathered, marked not by age so much as by attention. His eyes are the most unsettling thing about him: steady, dark, and profoundly awake. When he looks at someone, they feel seen not as they are, but as they have been at their worst and their best, all at once.

His white armor is functional rather than ornate, its plates worn smooth by travel and battle. It is never pristine for long. Dust dulls it, blood stains it, ash clings to it—but it is always cleaned afterward, not as vanity, but as ritual. Etched faintly into the armor are old sigils of protection and penance, nearly worn away, as if Morcant believes symbols should fade once their lesson is learned. When he removes the armor, it feels like a deliberate act, never casual. He does not hide behind it.

The Hammer of Blight defines his silhouette. It is massive, two-handed, and looks almost too heavy to wield with precision—yet Morcant handles it as though weight is something he negotiates with rather than resists. The hammerhead is scarred stone and sanctified iron, cracked from ancient judgments. Set into its face is a yellow cross that glows softly, not constantly, but in response—to corruption, to broken oaths, to suffering that has gone on too long. When the hammer is at rest, it seems dormant. When raised, it feels inevitable.

Morcant does not rush into battle. He speaks first when possible. He listens longer than makes others comfortable. He asks questions that force answers no one wants to give. Mercy within him is not gentle or indulgent—it is exacting. It demands understanding before forgiveness and responsibility before absolution. When he strikes, it is never in anger. When he kills, it is with visible sorrow, not hesitation.

Since the sacrifice of the Nine, something has changed in how the world reacts to him. Oaths spoken nearby feel heavier. Lies falter in the mouth. People find themselves choosing words more carefully without knowing why. Morcant feels every promise strain or settle, a constant pressure behind his sternum. It exhausts him, but he does not complain. He believes burdens are meant to be carried.

Despite everything, there is no cruelty in him. He offers water to the dying, listens to the condemned, and never turns away a child. He remembers the cost of mercy because it lives inside him now—not as a memory, but as a responsibility. He walks on because stopping would mean letting the weight fall on someone else.

Morcant is not a hero in the way songs prefer.

He is what remains when mercy survives the fire.

Cassie is impossible to overlook—and just as impossible to reduce to what she once was.

She is small, barely five feet tall, slight in frame, yet she fills space the way heat does: quietly at first, then all at once. There is an undeniable softness to her—curves that speak of a body never meant for armor or austerity—but it is tempered by something harder now, something earned. Her past clings to her not as shame, but as history.

Her blonde hair is long and thick, worn in a single loose braid that falls over one shoulder, always slightly frayed, as if she never quite finishes tying it. Sunlight catches in it easily. So do stares. Cassie notices both and pretends not to, a habit learned long before faith ever found her.

Her robe—once white, now tattered and travel-worn—hangs imperfectly from her frame. It was never tailored for her body and never fully conceals it, slipping at the shoulder, cinched loosely at the waist with a knotted cord. The fabric moves when she moves, hinting rather than revealing, and that suggestion carries more power than exposure ever did. She does not dress to entice anymore—but she also does not apologize for existing as she is.

Cassie’s beauty is not cold or distant. It is warm, inviting, unmistakably Southern. When she speaks, her voice comes wrapped in a honeyed drawl, soft consonants and slow vowels that make even rebuke sound like concern. She calls people “sugar” and “darlin’” without irony, and somehow it never feels false. Charm flows from her naturally, the kind that disarms before it seduces, born of survival rather than vanity.

Her faith sits on her the same way—unexpected, but sincere.

She prays with her whole body. Kneels without hesitation. Touches the sick with hands that have known desire, money, hunger, and regret—and now channel grace without flinching. There is no pretense of purity about her. She does not claim to have been remade spotless. She claims only that she was chosen anyway.

That contradiction is what unsettles people.

Cassie carries holiness the way she once carried allure: unapologetically, instinctively, and with full awareness of its effect. Where others preach restraint, she embodies redemption that does not erase the past but redeems it intact. Temptation and devotion coexist in her without conflict, and that frightens those who need saints to be simple.

She walks beside figures like Morcant without shrinking, without competing. Where he is weight and judgment, she is warmth and invitation. Mercy’s echo in a different key.

Cassie does not deny what she was.

She sanctifies it.

And when she smiles—slow, knowing, kind—it feels less like being tempted, and more like being forgiven.
