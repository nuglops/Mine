Morcant, as he walks the world after Kesh-Naru, is no longer easily mistaken for a wizard, nor fully for a knight. He is something heavier than either.

He is tall, but never seems to stand at his full height unless violence is unavoidable. His posture carries a habitual forward lean, as though he is always listening for something just ahead of him—a confession, a lie, a last chance to stop. His face is lean and weathered, marked not by age so much as by attention. His eyes are the most unsettling thing about him: steady, dark, and profoundly awake. When he looks at someone, they feel seen not as they are, but as they have been at their worst and their best, all at once.

His white armor is functional rather than ornate, its plates worn smooth by travel and battle. It is never pristine for long. Dust dulls it, blood stains it, ash clings to it—but it is always cleaned afterward, not as vanity, but as ritual. Etched faintly into the armor are old sigils of protection and penance, nearly worn away, as if Morcant believes symbols should fade once their lesson is learned. When he removes the armor, it feels like a deliberate act, never casual. He does not hide behind it.

The Hammer of Blight defines his silhouette. It is massive, two-handed, and looks almost too heavy to wield with precision—yet Morcant handles it as though weight is something he negotiates with rather than resists. The hammerhead is scarred stone and sanctified iron, cracked from ancient judgments. Set into its face is a yellow cross that glows softly, not constantly, but in response—to corruption, to broken oaths, to suffering that has gone on too long. When the hammer is at rest, it seems dormant. When raised, it feels inevitable.

Morcant does not rush into battle. He speaks first when possible. He listens longer than makes others comfortable. He asks questions that force answers no one wants to give. Mercy within him is not gentle or indulgent—it is exacting. It demands understanding before forgiveness and responsibility before absolution. When he strikes, it is never in anger. When he kills, it is with visible sorrow, not hesitation.

Since the sacrifice of the Nine, something has changed in how the world reacts to him. Oaths spoken nearby feel heavier. Lies falter in the mouth. People find themselves choosing words more carefully without knowing why. Morcant feels every promise strain or settle, a constant pressure behind his sternum. It exhausts him, but he does not complain. He believes burdens are meant to be carried.

Despite everything, there is no cruelty in him. He offers water to the dying, listens to the condemned, and never turns away a child. He remembers the cost of mercy because it lives inside him now—not as a memory, but as a responsibility. He walks on because stopping would mean letting the weight fall on someone else.

Morcant is not a hero in the way songs prefer.

He is what remains when mercy survives the fire.
