cupsdisable -r "hardware issue" printer_name
The printer is marked Stopped

cups-browsed sees it as unavailable

The printer is automatically removed from the implicit class

Jobs are sent only to the remaining printers

cupsenable printer_name
Rediscover it

Re-add it to the implicit class

Resume round-robin automatically

✔ No client changes
✔ No restarts required
✔ No risk of class corruption

This is the cleanest and safest method.
