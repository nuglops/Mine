  --autoshutdown=<mode>   Automatically shut down cups-browsed when inactive:
                          <mode> can be set to Off, On, or avahi, where Off
                          means that cups-browsed stays running permanently
                          (default), On means that it shuts down after 30
                          seconds (or any given timeout) of inactivity, and
                          avahi means that cups-browsed shuts down when
                          avahi-daemon shuts down.
  --autoshutdown-timout=<time> Timeout (in seconds) for auto-shutdown.
  --autoshutdown-on=<type> Type of inactivity which leads to an auto-
                          shutdown: If <type> is "no-queues", the shutdown
                          is triggered by not having any cups-browsed-created
                          print queue any more. With <type> being "no-jobs"
                          shutdown is initiated by no job being printed
                          on any cups-browsed-generated print queue any more.
                          "no-queues" is the default.
